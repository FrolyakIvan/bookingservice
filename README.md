# Booking Service

Front-End (Vue.js) + Back-End (Node.js)

It all works fine. To check it out please download it on your computer and initiate the app.

# Fron-end Init

Go to vue.js-client and run:
##  "$ npm run serve"


# Back-end Init

Stay in root folder and run this in your cmd line:
##  "$ node server.js"


# P.D:

  This app works with a "database.sql". I will attach you a file so you can upload it on you local MySql database storage
